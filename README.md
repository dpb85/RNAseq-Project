# RNAseq project

This study will explore the changes in gene expression between _Candida albicans_ organisms when grown in thiamine positive and thiamine negative environments, so as to better understand vitamin metabolism in _C. albicans_. This organism is a yeast of interest because under certain conditions it can be pathogenic. We have grown _C. albicans_ under thiamine present and thiamine absent conditions. For this study, we will use three biological replicates for each treatment condition. The files are labeled as follows:

This branch of the study will focuse on thiamine positive version of the "B" biological replicate; that is, WTB1. The workflow of this project is described under [MasterNotes](https://github.com/dpb85/RNAseq-Project/blob/main/MasterNotes).
