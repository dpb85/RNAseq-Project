# RNAseq project

This study will explore the changes in gene expression between _Candida albicans_ organisms when grown in thiamine positive and thiamine negative environments. This branch of the study will focuse on the "B" biological replicate of _Candida albicans_. Specifically, the Thi+ version of this replicate; that is, WTB1. The workflow of this project is described under [MasterNotes](https://github.com/dpb85/RNAseq-Project/blob/main/MasterNotes).
